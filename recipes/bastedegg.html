    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This recipe produces a delicious, simple egg with satisfying, set whites and a creamy, runny yolk. It's similar to a poached egg, but more flavorful and less fussy. 
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons salted butter</li>
        <li>2 lager eggs</li>
        <li>1 tabelspoon water</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoonfreshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch flaky sea salt, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. Carefully crack eggs into the skillet and let cook until whites have almost set, about 1 minute. Add water, cover skillet with a lid or cookie sheet, reduce heat to medium-low, and let cook until whites have set, yolks are still runny, and some of white has set over yolk, 1 to 2 more minutes. Remove lid and transfer eggs to a serving plate. Garnish with pepper and flaky salt, if desired. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
