    <h1>Falafel Cobb Salad</h1>

    <p>
      This is my take on an American-Mediterranean fusion. Well, we were also
      low in the protein area that night, so this was created. Considering the
      dish is a salad, it is still plenty filling and full of fresh flavors. The
      time spent making it is all in the prep work, then just simply assemble.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h3>Falafel</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ¼ cups water</li>
      <li>1 (6 ounce) package dry falafel mix</li>
      <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cucumber Dressing</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
      <li>¼ cup milk</li>
      <li>¼ cup diced cucumber</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh parsley</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Salad</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (10 ounce) bag mixed salad greens</li>
      <li>2 tomatoes, diced</li>
      <li>1 avocado, diced</li>
      <li>8 slices cooked bacon, crumbled</li>
      <li>3 hard-boiled eggs, diced</li>
      <li>¾ cup feta cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix water and falafel mix together in a bowl; let stand for 10 minutes.
        Form mixture into 12 patties, about 1/2-inch thick.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees
        C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Fry falafel patties, working in batches, in the hot oil until golden
        brown and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer cooked falafel to a paper
        towel-lined plate using a slotted spoon; season with salt. Cool falafel
        to room temperature; break into pieces.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk sour cream, milk, cucumber, parsley, and 1/8 teaspoon salt
        together in a bowl until dressing is smooth and creamy; refrigerate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread greens onto serving plates. Arrange tomatoes, avocado, bacon,
        eggs, feta cheese, and falafel in rows over the greens. Drizzle dressing
        over each salad.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Cook's Note:</h2>
    <p>
      Spinach or iceberg lettuce can also be used in place of mixed greens if
      desired.

    <h2>Editor's Note:</h2>
    <p>
      We have determined the nutritional value of oil for frying based on a
      retention value of 10% after cooking. The exact amount will vary depending
      on cooking time and temperature, ingredient density, and the specific type
      of oil used.
