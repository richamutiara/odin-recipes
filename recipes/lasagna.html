    <h1>Sour Cream Pancake</h1>
    <img src="../image/pancake.jpg" alt="image pancake">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe was passed to me by a friend and has become my families all time favorite pancake recipe. I always have sour cream on hand because I enjoy cooking with sour cream and we eat a lot of Mexican dishes. No longer will I be buying store bought mixes or using other recipes. This pancake recipe will seem odd because it has very little flour in it. The batter is very fluffy, which makes for a light, airy pancake, and the sour cream gives it a nice tangy</p>
